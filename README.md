# Investment-portfolio-optimization
The product uses IBM Optimization Portfolio Cloud Service based on Markowitz Algorithm. Achieve visualization by Hicharts. Used to predict the optimazed investment portfolio. 

# Instructions
Please find attached a Python code in Jupyter Notebook and two csv datafiles. 
You should run ipynb code on the cloud by registering for free cloud solution such as http://datascientistworkbench.com or by installing Python locally on your computer (for instance Anaconda distribution http://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Provided Python code implements portfolio optimization use case described at https://developer.ibm.com/code/journey/construct-a-socially-responsible-investment-portfolio/ based on Portfolio Optimization service from IBM Cloud https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/portfolio-optimization . 

You would need to register for IBM Cloud free trial account or can obtain a full one-year access via your university http://ibm.onthehub.com to run services on IBM Cloud.
